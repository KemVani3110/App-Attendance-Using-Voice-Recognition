## App Attendance Using Voice Recognition

## Overview

This project leverages voice recognition technology to manage attendance, developed using Python 3.12.2.

## Installation

To get started, install the necessary libraries by running the following commands:

    `pip install numpy`
    `pip install sounddevice`
    `pip install librosa`
    `pip install scikit-learn`
    `pip install tkinter`
    `pip install scipy`
    `pip install pandas openpyxl`
    
## Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Record voice samples:

    To record voice samples for the attendance system, run:

    `python record_voice.py`
    
    This script will help you record voice samples for the attendance system.

    You can record as many samples as you needâ€”the more, the better for the accuracy of the model.

2. Train the model:
    Next, train the voice recognition model with the recorded samples by executing:

    `python train_model.py`
    
    This script will train the voice recognition model using the dataset provided.

3. Recognize voice:
    Finally, use the app to recognize voices and mark attendance by running:

    `python recognize_voice.py`
    
    This script will recognize the voice and mark the attendance.

## Conclusion

This voice recognition attendance app offers a convenient and innovative way to track attendance. By recording, training, and recognizing voices, you can efficiently manage attendance records with minimal hassle.
