## App Attendance Using Voice Recognition

This project is ran on Visual Studio Code only.

## Overview

This project leverages voice recognition technology to manage attendance, developed using Python 3.12.2.

## Installation

To get started, install the necessary libraries by running the following commands:

    pip install numpy
    pip install sounddevice
    pip install librosa
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install tkinter
    pip install scipy
    pip install pandas openpyxl
    
## Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Record voice samples:

    To record voice samples for the attendance system, run:

    `python record_voice.py`
    
    This script will help you record voice samples for the attendance system.

    You can record as many samples as you needâ€”the more, the better for the accuracy of the model.

2. Train the model:
    Next, train the voice recognition model with the recorded samples by executing:

    `python train_model.py`
    
    This script will train the voice recognition model using the dataset provided.

3. Recognize voice:
    Finally, use the app to recognize voices and mark attendance by running:

    `python recognize_voice.py`
    
    This script will recognize the voice and mark the attendance.

## Preparing Training Data
To ensure optimal performance of the voice recognition system, follow these steps to prepare your training data:

1. Record at least 40 sound samples:

    Begin by recording a minimum of 40 distinct sound samples using the record_file.py script. These samples will form the core dataset required for offline testing.

2. Generate additional sound samples:

    Create more than 10 additional sound recordings. Place these extra samples in your initial_audio_files_yourname directory.

3. Organize your data for testing:

    The initial 40 sound files will be designated for Option 1: Offline Testing.
    The additional sound files will be allocated for Option 2: Online Testing.

By carefully preparing and organizing your audio samples, you will ensure a robust training dataset that enhances the accuracy and reliability of the voice recognition model.

## Conclusion

This voice recognition attendance app offers a convenient and innovative way to track attendance. By recording, training, and recognizing voices, you can efficiently manage attendance records with minimal hassle.
